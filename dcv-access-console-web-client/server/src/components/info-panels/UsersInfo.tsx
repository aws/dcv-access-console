                    Users are saved in your datastore, and appear here if they have been directly imported from the Access Console, or have already logged in. For a complete list of users that are authorized to log into the Access Console, you must refer to your externally configured users datastore.
                    <br/><br/>
                    You can view available users, and their detailed information. You can configure the visible fields in the top navigation bar by selecting the gear icon.
                    <br/><br/>
                    To view more details in a split panel view, select a user, and then select the <code>^</code> button at the bottom-right corner of the page.
                </p>

                <h3>User roles</h3>
                <p>
                    There are two roles a user can have with the Access Console - <b>admin</b> and <b>user</b>. To change a userâ€™s role, you must edit the user directly from your configured datastore.
                    <br/><br/>
                    <b>Admins</b> can create sessions, view and connect to all sessions, create and modify session templates, view host information, view and import users, and create and modify user groups.
                    <br/><br/>
                    <b>Users</b> can create and connect to their own sessions.
                </p>
