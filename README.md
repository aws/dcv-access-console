## DCV Access Console
The DCV Access Console is a web application that helps administrators and end users manage their Amazon DCV sessions.
The Access Console consists of installable software packages that include a Handler, an Authentication Server, a Web Client, and a Setup Wizard configured to provide a graphical interface.
This repository contains the source code for the Handler, the Web Client, and the Setup Wizard components currently. The Authentication Server component will be added later.
The DCV release version of the Authentication Server can be obtained via [DCV Downloads](https://www.amazondcv.com/#:~:text=Amazon%20DCV%202024.0%20Access%20Console).
